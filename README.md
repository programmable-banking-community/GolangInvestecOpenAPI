# Investec Open API SDK for Go


## installation

make sure you are in your root of your project folder
and you have a go.mod file there if not you just need to
create it with

```bash
go mod init <project name>
```

```bash
go get -v github.com/devinpearson/investec-open-api-sdk-go
```


## Usage

before you start you will need to have the `clientID`, `secret` and `apiKey` from Investec.
then you are good to proceed.

```golang
package main

import (
    ***

	client "github.com/devinpearson/investec-open-api-sdk-go"

    ***
)


func main() {
    // need to have secret and clientID then fill in these vars.
    secret := ""
    clientID := ""
    apiKey := ""

    clt := client.NewBankingClient(secret, clientID, apiKey)

    // OAuth to the API
    if err := clt.GetAccessToken(); err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    // Get Accounts.
    accounts, err := clt.GetAccounts()
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    // see the specification of the account type in `api/api.go`
    fmt.Println("Accounts", accounts) 

    // Get Account Balance
    var accountID string = accounts.Data.AccountArr[0].AccountID
    balance, err := clt.GetAccountBalance(accountID)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    fmt.Println("balance", balance)

    // Get account transactions
    // you can use fromDate and toData params to filter the transactions.
    // see investecOpenAPI.go file the dates need to have ISO 8601 format.
    transactions, err := clt.GetAccountTransactions(accountID, "", "")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    
    fmt.Println("transactions", transactions)
}
